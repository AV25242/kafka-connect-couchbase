= Couchbase Cloud Support
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
Connecting to Couchbase Cloud is very similar to connecting to any Couchbase cluster over an encrypted connection. This section explains how.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must use a Kafka connector version of *4.0.1 or higher*, earlier versions will not work.
====

== Certificate Download

Once you have created a Cluster in Couchbase Cloud, navigate to the `Connect` tab and download the security certificate.

== Keystore Setup

The downloaded certificate is in `pem` format, so we need to convert it into a `der` format first. The `openssl` tool can be utilized for this task:

[source]
----
$ openssl x509 -outform der -in your-root-certificate.pem -out your-root-certificate.der
----

Next, the certificate needs to be imported into your java keystore

[#trust-store]
== Add Certificates to the Trust Store

The connector's trust store is a Java keystore file containing the certificates the connector should trust.
We'll use the Java `keytool` command to create a keystore and populate it with the root certificates for Couchbase Cloud.

To add the Couchbase Cloud root certificate:

[source]
----
$ keytool -importcert -keystore truststore.jks -file your-root-certificate.der
----
If the keystore file `truststore.jks` does not yet exist, you will be prompted to choose a password for the new keystore.
Otherwise, you will be prompted for the password of the existing keystore.

You will then be presented with a summary of the information in the certificate, and asked if you want to trust the certificate.
If the information is correct, enter `y` to confirm.

You can verify that it has been stored with `keytool -list`:

[source]
----
$ keytool -list
Enter keystore password:
Keystore type: PKCS12
Keystore provider: SUN

Your keystore contains 1 entry
----

== Kafka Configuration

Now that your keystore contains the cloud certificate, the last step is to provide Kafka `Security` configurations.

 Enable tls by setting *couchbase.enable.tls* to `true`.

 Set keystore path *couchbase.trust.store.path* as absolute filesystem path to `truststore.jks`.

 Configure *couchbase.trust.store.password*  by providing the keystore password.

After everything is configured, you can use all the APIs like you would against a regular Couchbase Server installation.
